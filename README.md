What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The project was meant to help ABCU Advisors when talking to students by providing a program that printed out course information for programs provided by the school. The program took a file, loaded it into the memory, then allowed the user to print all courses in the program, or search for a specific course in the program. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I had to determine which data structure was better to traverse. Ulitmately I went with a BST because it was easier to organize and order each course (alphanumerically) while traversing the nodes was easier to program.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
The biggest roadblock I ran into was figuring out how the nodes worked, specifically with vectors. I found knowing what node was being pointed towards a little confusing when coding a vector. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
In terms of design, I have a better understanding of how to load in data and what data structures to utilize. This will be more important when dealing with bigger projects. I feel like runtime and memory analysis will be important moving forward, however I am still a little confused with how to calculate the big O notation. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The project really taught me to break down functions piece by piece to allow easier maintenance of the code. Effective comments within the code are also essential to helping the process of designing the program. Adaptability is the one place I could do better in as I hard coded the file I wanted to load in rather than allowing for the file to be input by the user. This was an oversight on my end that I didn't realize I needed to do.
